###### tuple is like lists but there are two differences

#### 1)  It is immutable(means we can't add or remove element from it)
#### 2)  iT IS Intialized BY () and it is faster than conventional list


tup=(10,4,7,10.3,"Ali")
print(tup[3])

for i in tup:
    print(i)




###### sets in python
#### faster than both list and tuple because it follows hashing
##### Initialized values using {}, like conventional sets in math.
#### it is also immutable
#### we can't index sets because it stores on random locations

s={5,7,34,22,11,56}
print(s)
